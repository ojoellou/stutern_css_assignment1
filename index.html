          My name is <strong>Lou</strong> and I love learning about new and
          emerging technology. I am currently learning more about
          <i>backend development</i> to help me understand how to build better
          products for consumers.

        <p id="css-introduction">
          So far in the <b>stutern development program</b>, I have learnt how to
          use <i>HTML to build the content of a web page</i> and how to use
          <i>CSS to build the look of a page</i>. CSS gives an otherwise plain
          page structure and style. CSS is the language we use to style an HTML
          document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

          <strong>Padding</strong> - The inner space between the content and the
          border of your box. <br /><strong>Border</strong> - The perimeter of
          the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored
          line like the green one pictured above. <br /><strong>Margin</strong>
          - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. <br />The
          main <i>difference</i> between padding and margin is that padding controls
          how much breathing room exists within a box, while margin controls how
          much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box.
